# Equation Editor

Equation Editor allows you to embed equations into Quip documents. Equations are written using TeX and rendered with the [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) library.

This is an example of using rich text boxes to store data and "detached" nodes to extend your app beyond its initial boundaries.
