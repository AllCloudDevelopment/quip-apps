# Einstein Analytics

This is the code we're using to connect to a LightningOut Einstein Analytics component. 

Because LightningOut requires the iframe to set `unsafe-eval` this isn't an app you'll be able to deploy but it will work in Use Local Resources mode. The code is provided here mostly as a proof of concept.
